                <h4>Phase 1: Ideation</h4>
                <p>In April 2024, the researchers developed the idea for a project focused on subvocal interactionâ€”a tool which utilizes the lip features of the user. It serves as an alternative to human-computer interaction and a potential multimodal approach to tackling speech impairment.</p>

                <h4>Phase 2: Take Off</h4>
                <p>By August 2024, the researchers started the design phase. They planned the structure of the project and decided to use the Rapid Application Development (RAD) methodology to guide the development of the app. The phase involved figuring out the project's goals and how it would work.</p>

                <h4>Phase 3: Development</h4>
                <p>November 2024, the researchers started coding the very complex part of lip reading interface, THE lip reading part! Rams Gallo, lead developer, tackled plenty of development paths. Creating the SSI model architecture > train the model > but to what dataset? Thus, researchers had to make a external tool for data collection. The development continues...</p>

                <h4>Phase 4: Testing & Review</h4>
                <p>December 2024, the researchers conducted an interview and a timebox review, to gather feedback, with a registered speech pathologist at Kidvincible Tutorial and Learning Center in Bacoor, Cavite to provide necessary insight on the current state of speech impairment in the Philippines and the potential benefits of lip-reading SSI technology for the people with speech impairment.</p>
