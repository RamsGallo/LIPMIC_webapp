                    <h4>Phase 1: Ideation</h4>
                    <p>In April 2024, the team envisioned a tool for subvocal interaction. This concept focuses on utilizing lip movements as an alternative method of human-computer interaction, especially to assist individuals with speech impairments.</p>

                    <h4>Phase 2: Take Off</h4>
                    <p>By August 2024, the researchers started the design phase. They planned the structure of the project and decided to use the Rapid Application Development (RAD) methodology to guide the development of the app. The phase involved figuring out the project's goals and how it would work.</p>

                    <h4>Phase 3: Development</h4>
                    <p>November 2024, the researchers started coding the very complex part of lip reading interface, THE lip reading part! Rams Gallo, lead developer, tackled plenty of development paths. Creating the SSI model architecture > train the model > but to what dataset? Thus, researchers had to make an external tool for data collection. The development continues...</p>

                    <h4>Phase 4: Testing & Review</h4>
                    <p>In December 2024, the researchers conducted an interview and a timebox review to gather feedback, with a registered speech pathologist at Kidvincible Tutorial and Learning Center in Bacoor, Cavite. The aim was to provide necessary insight on the current state of speech impairment in the Philippines and the potential benefits of lip-reading SSI technology for people with speech impairments.</p>
